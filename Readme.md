Python application to easily manage finances of several rental properties.
In first instance this will be a shell application. In a later project a GUI might be added.

    - information about rental properties
    - income and expenses

Aimed functionality of the application:
    - Command line interface
    - Store data in a database
        - CSV-file
        - further development to SQL database
    - input/output of data initially directly into CSV
        - through python functions for later extendability of application
    - Read income and expenses from database into pandas DF
    - Store information about rental properties
    - Store information about tenants
    - Analyze financial parameters, e.g. return on investment
